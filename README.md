I am not very proud of the result, but so far, it gets it's job done. I've been in desperate need of any RP death script working for my ESX server, which would have:

**1) wasted screen of some sort**

**2) respawn on hospital**

**3) money loss in SQL for ESX servers as prevention against random idiots who would shoot anybody on sight, "because they can"**

  as a result of above, it should force players to rather try to play cool or go dirty and risk jail (in case of my server - temp ban). But the risk of getting shot should be the last option, as with current script set up, the player will loose almost all money both in cash and bank account.

**Known bugs:**

- I can't turn off the autorespawn after death, script instead in few milliseconds will spawn the player to hospital
- bank account is not refreshing after death

**To do:**

- get percentage money loss, both for cash and for bank acc
- respawn to nearest hospital, instead of one or random
